### Why Frameworks?
  - Code is messy, you need some way to **organize** your code.
  - Leverage **solved** problem
  - Use **proven** techniques
  - Allow for easy **collaboration**
  - Things will **Change**
  - Optimize for change.
    - "I'm more interested in optimizing a person's **understanding of problem** than their understanding of solutions."  --Kris Gale(fromer VPE Yammer)

### What are the problems?
  - Fetching/storing **state**
  - Rendering HTML
  - **Binding** state to DOM
  - Client **routing**
  - **Server-side** rendering
  - Composing **views**

### Framework Rundown
  - Angular
    - Easy to start
    - Logic mixed with HTML
    - You're learning Angular, **Not JS** (big deal)
    - Highly abstracted
  - Ember
    - Lots of decisions made for you
    - Everything is 'ember' as a base
    - Lack of flexibility
    - Rather large
  - Backbone
    - First one to go big
    - Basic building blocks
    - Extremely flexible
    - Extremely broadly deployed
    - You have to solve more problems
  - React
    - Not really a framework
    - View layer
    - Doesn't directly deal with storing state
    - Can render server-side
    - Can re-inflate
    - Dramatically simplifies bindings
  - Ampersand
    - Fork of Backbone
    - A fear-of-commitment framework
    - No "core" modules
    - Individual npm modules
    - Insanely flexible

<hr>

### Final Thoughts
  - Optimize for **readbility**
  - Static **analysis** (in code review)
    - Standard
    - Eslint.org
    - Jscs.org
  - Emotion-free **Code Style Enforcement**
  - Make it part of your testing
  - Private, shared code? Npm private modules? Npm enterprise?
  - Evangelize **open source** at your company [URL](bit.ly/os-charity)

### Open Hacking
  - Link to real repos
  - Form validation
  - User avatar
  - Store JSON in issues API to persist arbitrary data on github
  - Add label presets you can apply to a repo
  - Switch it over to firebase
  - Write modules that fetches all repos, using Github's Paging Headers
  - Add a color picker
